# Chat with Multiple PDFs using Gemini

This project, **Chat with Multiple PDFs**, is a Streamlit-based application that allows users to upload multiple PDF files, process their content, and ask questions about the content using Gemini's AI-powered conversational capabilities. The AI provides accurate and contextual answers based on the provided PDFs.

---

## Features

- Upload multiple PDF files for processing.
- Extract text from PDF files using PyPDF2.
- Split text into manageable chunks for efficient querying.
- Use FAISS for vector storage to enable similarity-based search.
- Leverage Google's Gemini (Generative AI) for advanced natural language processing and question answering.
- Interactive and user-friendly Streamlit interface.

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have:

1. Python 3.8 or higher installed.
2. A valid API key for Google Generative AI.
3. Installed all required dependencies using the provided requirements file.

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Babaiii07/Chat_with_multiple_pdfs.git
   cd chat_with_multiple_pdfs
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate # For macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up your environment variable:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add your Google API key:
     ```env
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key
     ```

## Running the Application

1. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run pdf_bot.py
   ```

2. Open the provided URL in your browser (usually `http://localhost:8501`).

3. Use the sidebar to upload your PDF files and process them.

4. Ask questions in the input field, and the AI will provide detailed answers based on the uploaded content.

## Project Structure

- `pdf_bot.py`: Main Python file containing the application logic.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required Python packages.
- `.env`: Environment variables file (for the API key).

---

## Key Python Packages

- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive user interface.
- **PyPDF2**: For extracting text from PDF files.
- **langchain**: For creating conversational AI chains and text splitting.
- **FAISS**: For efficient similarity-based searches.
- **google.generativeai**: For integrating with Gemini AI models.

---

## How It Works

1. **Upload PDFs**: Users can upload one or more PDF files via the sidebar.
2. **Text Extraction**: Extracts raw text from the uploaded PDFs.
3. **Text Splitting**: Splits the text into chunks using a recursive text splitter.
4. **Vectorization**: Stores text chunks in FAISS using embeddings generated by Gemini.
5. **Question Answering**: Searches for the most relevant context in the vector store and answers user queries based on the extracted content.

---

## Notes

- Ensure your Google API key has sufficient permissions to use Gemini AI services.
- Avoid uploading sensitive or confidential PDF files as the data may be processed externally.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for more file formats (e.g., DOCX, TXT).
- Implement user authentication for personalized usage.
- Improve UI/UX with advanced Streamlit features.
- Optimize text chunking and vector storage for faster response times.
